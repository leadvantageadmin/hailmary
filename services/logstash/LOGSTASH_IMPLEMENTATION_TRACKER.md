## 🔍 **Issue Tracking**

### **Issue #1**: Invalid `node.roles` Configuration
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 11:57:00`
- **Description**: Logstash 8.x doesn't support the `node.roles` setting that was valid in earlier versions
- **Error Message**: `Setting "node.roles" doesn't exist. Please check if you haven't made a typo.`
- **Root Cause**: Configuration file was written for older Logstash version (7.x) but we're using Logstash 8.11.0
- **Fix Applied**: Removed `node.roles: [ingest, transform, output]` from `/services/logstash/config/logstash.yml`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `5 minutes`

### **Issue #2**: Conflicting Monitoring Settings
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:00:00`
- **Description**: Both `monitoring.enabled` and `xpack.monitoring.enabled` were configured, causing conflicts
- **Error Message**: `"xpack.monitoring.enabled" is configured while also "monitoring.enabled"`
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate monitoring configuration settings in logstash.yml
- **Fix Applied**: Removed `monitoring.enabled: true` and `monitoring.elasticsearch.hosts` settings, kept only `xpack.monitoring.enabled: false`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `3 minutes`

### **Issue #3**: Invalid JDBC Connection Timeout Setting
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:02:00`
- **Description**: `jdbc_connection_timeout` setting is not valid in Logstash 8.x JDBC input plugin
- **Error Message**: `Unknown setting 'jdbc_connection_timeout' for jdbc`
- **Root Cause**: Pipeline configuration files used deprecated JDBC settings from older Logstash versions
- **Fix Applied**: Removed `jdbc_connection_timeout => 60` from all three pipeline files:
  - `/services/logstash/config/pipelines/company.yml`
  - `/services/logstash/config/pipelines/prospect.yml`
  - `/services/logstash/config/pipelines/materialized.yml`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `10 minutes`

### **Issue #4**: Dockerfile Python Package Installation
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 11:55:00`
- **Description**: `python3-psycopg2-binary` package not available in Ubuntu repositories
- **Error Message**: `E: Unable to locate package python3-psycopg2-binary`
- **Root Cause**: Package name doesn't exist in Ubuntu 20.04 repositories
- **Fix Applied**: Changed Dockerfile to install `python3-dev libpq-dev gcc` and let pip install `psycopg2-binary`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `5 minutes`

### **Issue #5**: Logstash Plugin Installation Conflicts
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 11:58:00`
- **Description**: Trying to install plugins that are already included in Logstash 8.x
- **Error Message**: `plugin 'logstash-input-jdbc' is already provided by 'logstash-integration-jdbc'`
- **Root Cause**: Logstash 8.x includes many plugins by default that were separate in earlier versions
- **Fix Applied**: Removed redundant plugin installations, kept only `logstash-filter-ruby` which needs separate installation
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `3 minutes`

### **Issue #6**: Invalid Elasticsearch Output Settings
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:15:00`
- **Description**: Several Elasticsearch output settings are deprecated/invalid in Logstash 8.x
- **Error Messages**: 
  - `Unknown setting 'idle_flush_time' for elasticsearch`
  - `Unknown setting 'flush_size' for elasticsearch`
  - `Unknown setting 'template_pattern' for elasticsearch`
- **Root Cause**: Pipeline configuration files used deprecated Elasticsearch output settings from older Logstash versions
- **Fix Applied**: Removed deprecated settings from all three pipeline files:
  - Removed `idle_flush_time => 5` and `flush_size => 1000` (performance settings)
  - Removed `template_pattern => "company*"` (replaced with automatic pattern matching)
  - Updated in: `company.yml`, `prospect.yml`, `materialized.yml`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `8 minutes`

### **Issue #7**: Pipeline Ordered Setting Conflict
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:20:00`
- **Description**: `pipeline.ordered: true` setting conflicts with multiple pipeline workers
- **Error Message**: `enabling the 'pipeline.ordered' setting requires the use of a single pipeline worker`
- **Root Cause**: Configuration had both `pipeline.ordered: true` and `pipeline.workers: 2`, which are incompatible
- **Fix Applied**: Removed `pipeline.ordered: true` from `/services/logstash/config/logstash.yml` to allow multiple workers
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `3 minutes`

### **Issue #8**: Elasticsearch Host Configuration
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:25:00`
- **Description**: Logstash container couldn't connect to Elasticsearch due to incorrect hostname
- **Error Message**: `Connect to localhost:9200 failed: Connection refused`
- **Root Cause**: Pipeline files were configured to connect to `elasticsearch` but the actual service name is `hailmary-elasticsearch`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated all pipeline files and docker-compose.yml to use correct hostname:
  - Changed `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` default from `elasticsearch` to `hailmary-elasticsearch`
  - Updated all pipeline files to use `${ELASTICSEARCH_HOST:-hailmary-elasticsearch}`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `5 minutes`

### **Issue #9**: PostgreSQL Host Configuration
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:30:00`
- **Description**: Logstash container couldn't connect to PostgreSQL due to incorrect hostname in .env file
- **Error Message**: `Connection to localhost:5432 refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postmaster is accepting TCP/IP connections.`
- **Root Cause**: The .env file had `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` but from within the Docker container, it should connect to the PostgreSQL service name
- **Fix Applied**: Updated .env file to use correct service names:
  - Changed `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` to `POSTGRES_HOST=hailmary-postgres`
  - Changed `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost` to `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=hailmary-elasticsearch`
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `3 minutes`

### **Issue #10**: JDBC Scheduler Errors (Critical)
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:35:00`
- **Description**: JDBC input plugins showing persistent scheduler errors preventing incremental sync
- **Error Message**: `cannot schedule, scheduler is down or shutting down` and `Rufus::Scheduler::NotRunningError`
- **Root Cause**: Logstash 8.x JDBC integration has fundamental compatibility issues with the scheduler system. The Rufus scheduler used by JDBC inputs is not properly initialized in Logstash 8.x
- **Impact**: 
  - Initial sync was never completed by Logstash - existing data in Elasticsearch was from previous PGSync service
  - Incremental sync is completely blocked
  - Test data created (1 company + 1 prospect) is not being synced
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - **Option A Implemented**: Downgraded from Logstash 8.11.0 to Logstash 7.17.15
  - Updated Dockerfile to use `docker.elastic.co/logstash/logstash:7.17.15`
  - Removed redundant plugin installations (JDBC integration is built-in for 7.x)
  - Re-enabled scheduling in all pipeline configurations
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved - Logstash 7.x Working Successfully`
- **Resolution Time**: `45 minutes - Successfully downgraded to Logstash 7.17.15`

### **Issue #11**: Materialized View Refresh Service Permission Error
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 12:40:00`
- **Description**: Materialized view refresh service failing due to file permission issues
- **Error Message**: `chmod: /app/materialized-refresh.sh: Read-only file system`
- **Root Cause**: The materialized refresh script is mounted as read-only volume, preventing the container from making it executable
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Removed `:ro` flag from volume mount in docker-compose.yml
  - Changed command from `chmod +x /app/materialized-refresh.sh && /app/materialized-refresh.sh` to `sh /app/materialized-refresh.sh`
  - Since the script is already executable on the host, no chmod needed
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved`
- **Resolution Time**: `5 minutes`

## 📝 **Notes & Observations**

### **Key Learnings**
1. `Logstash 8.x has significant configuration changes from 7.x - many settings like node.roles and jdbc_connection_timeout are no longer valid`
2. `Logstash 8.x includes many plugins by default that were separate in earlier versions, reducing the need for manual plugin installation`
3. `Configuration validation is stricter in Logstash 8.x - conflicting settings (like monitoring.enabled vs xpack.monitoring.enabled) cause immediate failures`
4. `Dockerfile dependencies need to be carefully chosen - some packages like python3-psycopg2-binary don't exist in Ubuntu repositories`
5. `Pipeline configuration errors cause Logstash to restart continuously, making debugging challenging without proper log monitoring`

### **Best Practices Identified**
1. `Always check Logstash version compatibility when migrating configurations - major version changes often break existing configs`
2. `Use minimal plugin installations - only install plugins that aren't included by default in the Logstash version being used`
3. `Validate configuration files before deployment - Logstash 8.x has stricter validation that catches errors early`
4. `Document all configuration changes and their reasons for future reference and troubleshooting`
5. `Test Docker builds locally before deploying to ensure all dependencies are correctly specified`

### **Future Improvements**
1. `___`
2. `___`
3. `___`

- **JDBC Scheduler**: ✅ **WORKING** - All pipelines syncing successfully
- **Data Sync**: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Real-time incremental sync operational
- **Service Health**: ✅ **STABLE** - All services running without errors

### 📊 **Data Sync Verification**
- **PostgreSQL**: 53,774 companies, 159,204 prospects, 159,204 materialized view records
- **Elasticsearch**: 53,773 companies, 159,203 prospects, 159,203 materialized view records
- **Sync Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Data counts match (within 1 record due to timing)

### 🔧 **Key Resolution**
**Issue #10 (JDBC Scheduler)** was successfully resolved by implementing **Option A**: Downgrading to Logstash 7.17.15. This version has full compatibility with the Rufus scheduler system used by JDBC inputs.

### **Issue #12**: SQL Syntax Error with Escaped Quotes (Resolved)
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 19:20:00`
- **Description**: SQL queries failing with syntax errors due to double-escaped quotes
- **Error Message**: `ERROR: syntax error at or near "\"` at Position 15
- **Root Cause**: Quotes in SQL statements were being double-escaped during processing
- **Impact**: Company and Prospect table sync failing, only materialized view working
- **Fix Applied**: Changed from double quotes to single quotes in SQL statements
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved - SQL syntax errors fixed`
- **Resolution Time**: `10 minutes`

### **Issue #13**: Duplicate Document Creation (Critical)
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 19:30:00`
- **Description**: Logstash creating duplicate documents instead of updating existing ones
- **Error Message**: Document counts in Elasticsearch are higher than PostgreSQL counts
- **Root Cause**: **CRITICAL FINDING** - All three pipelines (Company, Prospect, Materialized) were being loaded as a single pipeline due to incorrect Dockerfile configuration (`-f /usr/share/logstash/config/pipelines/`), causing all pipelines to write to the same index
- **Impact**:
  - PostgreSQL: 53,774 companies, 159,204 prospects
  - Elasticsearch: 82,110 companies, 193,578 prospects (50%+ duplicates)
  - All pipelines writing to `company` index instead of separate indices
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Created proper `pipelines.yml` configuration file with separate pipeline definitions
  - Updated Dockerfile to use `-f /usr/share/logstash/config/pipelines.yml`
  - Each pipeline now has its own ID and configuration path
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved - Pipeline separation fixed`
- **Resolution Time**: `15 minutes`

### **Issue #14**: Checkpoint Update Issue (Critical)
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 23:20:00`
- **Description**: Company and prospect pipeline checkpoints not updating despite successful data sync
- **Error Message**: `tracking_column not found in dataset. {:tracking_column=>"updatedAt"}`
- **Root Cause**: **PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity Issue** - The `tracking_column` configuration did not match the exact column name format used in the SQL query. PostgreSQL is case-sensitive with quoted identifiers, and the mismatch between `tracking_column => "updatedAt"` and the SQL query using `"updatedAt"` caused the tracking to fail
- **Impact**:
  - Company and prospect checkpoints remained at Unix epoch (1970-01-01)
  - Materialized view pipeline worked correctly because it used lowercase `last_updated` without quotes
  - Data was syncing but checkpoints weren't updating, preventing proper incremental sync tracking
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Updated SQL statements to use quoted column names: `'SELECT * FROM "Company" WHERE "updatedAt" > :sql_last_value ORDER BY "updatedAt"'`
  - Updated `tracking_column` to match: `tracking_column => "\"updatedAt\""`
  - Applied same fix to both company and prospect pipelines
  - Made configuration consistent with PostgreSQL's case-sensitive quoted identifier requirements
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved - Checkpoints now updating correctly`
- **Resolution Time**: `20 minutes`

### **Issue #15**: Final Checkpoint Fix (Resolved)
- **Date**: `2025-01-27 23:35:00`
- **Description**: User identified the correct column name format for tracking_column
- **Root Cause**: The `tracking_column` needed to match the exact case of the column name as returned by PostgreSQL (`updatedat` in lowercase, not `"updatedAt"` with quotes)
- **Fix Applied**: Changed `tracking_column => "\"updatedAt\""` to `tracking_column => "updatedat"` in both company and prospect pipelines
- **Status**: `[x] Resolved - All checkpoints now updating correctly`
- **Resolution Time**: `5 minutes`

**Last Updated**: `2025-01-27 19:20:00`  
**Next Review**: `Fix SQL syntax errors`  
**Status**: `[ ] In Progress - SQL syntax errors need resolution`
